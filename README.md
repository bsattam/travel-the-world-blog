## Motivation
I developed this website while learning backend technologies. I used express for backend server, and mongoDB as database. I used React for frontend.

## Features
- CRUD operations for blogs
- Authentication using bcrypt
- Sorting blogs based on Author or Category
- Compressing images and uploading them on AWS S3

## Demo
